    <title>Eventos HTML</title>

    <p>An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some examples of HTML events:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An HTML web page has finished loading</li>
        <li>An HTML input field was changed</li>
        <li>An HTML button was clicked</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
    </p>
    <p>HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
    </p>


    <p>With single quotes:</p>
    <code>
    &lt;element event='some JavaScript'&gt;
</code>
